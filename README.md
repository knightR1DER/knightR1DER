## 🧑‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm that guy who gets excited about new programming languages like others get excited about new Netflix series! When I'm not wrestling with algorithms, you'll find me analyzing match tactics or perfecting the art of power napping between coding sessions. 😴

```python
class AyushPaudel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Ayush Paudel"
        self.role = "CSE Student & Aspiring Developer"
        self.location = "Nepal 🇳🇵"
        self.interests = ["Coding", "Football", "Learning", "Sleeping"]
        self.current_status = "Trying all technologies (literally all of them!)"
        self.mission = "To try every framework known to humanity"
        
    def daily_routine(self):
        return ["☕ Code", "⚽ Football", "😴 Sleep", "🔄 Repeat"]
        
    def current_mood(self):
        return "Optimistically debugging"
        
    def fun_fact(self):
        return "Best debugging happens during halftime! ⚽💡"
```
